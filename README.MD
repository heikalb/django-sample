# Django sample: the lost pets of Mallardville

This project is to showcase me learning Django. The webapp implemented here is
a website for lost pet posters of a fictional town. Through the website users 
can view, create and delete posters, and each poster consists of information 
like title, description and pet image. Posters are of two types: for lost pets
and for pets found.

This project involved working on models and their fields, forms, views, 
URL routing, HTML templates and CSS styling.

The webapp is deployed at http://heikalb.pythonanywhere.com
